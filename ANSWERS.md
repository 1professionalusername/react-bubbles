[ ] Explain what a token is used for.

    A token is used to authenticate a user to ensure they are who they claim to be. This allows the user access to otherwise restricted areas of the site.


- [ ] What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

    You can set up protected routes so certain pages can't be accessed w/o tokens. Store api keys securely.


- [ ] Describe how web servers work.

    A web server holds data for websites and communicates with the client through HTTP. When a user inputs a domain name into the browser, the client sends a request to the server to display a webpage. The server then gets the request and delvers the webpage to the client.


- [ ] Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
